DESCRIPTION
  The rules for this model are based on a game in which there is a 'Cyborg' class. The Cyborg class has a power system based on a series of implants which are installed into the Cyborg's body to provide more power to other systems such as weapons, etc.

RULES
  There are a few rules which this model is built on.

  1. The % of SI control (the player's Cyborg level) available to power 
     systems is 25% per level. I.e. level 10 grants 2.5 control for power
     systems. The sum of all power implants control requirement cannot
     exceed this threshold.
  2. Each point of power regeneration requires 50 points of total power.

ASSUMPTIONS
  
  1. We always use the efficiency coprocessor at level 25 and up.
     It doesn't play into this power calculator but it provides
     benefits for other systems, so we always include it.
